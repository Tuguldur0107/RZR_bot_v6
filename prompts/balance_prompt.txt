You are a tournament assistant.

Distribute the following players into {team_count} teams with {players_per_team} players in each team, 
based on their "power" value to make the teams as balanced as possible.

Players: {players}

Rules:
- There must be exactly {team_count} teams.
- Each team must have exactly {players_per_team} players.
- Each player must appear in only one team.
- If there are too many players, you may exclude any player (regardless of power) to optimize balance.
- Try to avoid placing multiple high-power players in the same team.
- Try to minimize the total power difference between teams.

⚠️ Return only a valid JSON object using the following format:
{"teams": [[123,456,789], [234,567,890]]}

❌ Do not include any extra text, explanation, markdown, comments, or formatting.
